On your ﬁrst morning you will be met by one of the administration team either at the FIL, MPC or Bedford Way, depending on where your desk will be based. They will arrange for you to have a building induction, introduce you to key people, get your access card and show you to your desk and computer. There are a few things you need to do within your ﬁrst few weeks for both UCL and the lab, see below for a checklist. If there is anything you seem to be missing, please ask Sarah (lab manager), Steve or senior lab members and we’ll point you in the right direction.

### General checklist:

* Building induction
* Access card
* IT induction
* Fire safety walkthrough
* Mandatory UCL staﬀ moodle courses
  - DSE assessment
  - Diversity
  - Fire safety
  - Freedom of information
  - Data protection
  - Information security
* Scanning safety session at 12 Queen Square (if you’ll be doing any scanning with us)

### Lab Checklist:

* Make sure you have been added to:

  - MetaLab Google calendar
  - MetaLab Dropbox
  - Consciousness Club mailing list
  - [Github](https://github.com/metacoglab)
  - [MetaLab people page](https://github.com/metacoglab)

* Have a browse through the [FIL intranet](http://intranet.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/)
* Make a start on the key readings (see next)

## Reading

To build a common knowledge base for everyone in the lab, we recommend reading the following theoretical / review papers:

* Metacognition and confidence: A review and synthesis - [Fleming 2024](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-psych-022423-032425)
* How to measure metacognition - [Fleming & Lau 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00443/full)
* Self-evaluation of decision-making: A general Bayesian framework for metacognitive computation - [Fleming & Daw 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5178868/)
* Awareness as inference in a higher-order state space - [Fleming 2020](https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2020/1/niz020/5803146)
* Understanding the higher-order approach to consciousness - [Brown, Lau & LeDoux, 2019](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(19)30161-5)

In addition, please check out our papers published in the past 12-18 months, particularly preprints, to get a sense of what we're actively pursuing. These are all available on our [Publications page](http://metacoglab.org/publications).

For more general overviews and informal discussions, you can download podcasts and interviews that Steve and other lab members have participated in over the years on our [Media page](http://metacoglab.org/media)
