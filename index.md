Welcome to the [MetaLab!](http://metacoglab.org/)

We are based primarily at the [Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/brain-sciences/icn), also known as the ICN. Many of the lab also have affiliations with either the [Department of Experimental Psychology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/experimental-psychology/) and/or the [Max Planck Centre for Computational Psychiatry](https://www.mps-ucl-centre.mpg.de/). We also work closely with the the [Department of Imaging Neuroscience](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/) (also known as the FIL - Functional Imaging Laboratory), where we run most of our neuroimaging experiments. It might seem confusing at first, but all of these units are part of University College London (UCL). We hope you have an excellent and productive time during your stay in the lab! This manual was developed by the lab PI, Steve Fleming together with other group members, and is a rough outline of how Steve expects the lab to function within the wider ICN and UCL infrastructure (who’s rules and policies should take precedence). 

It’s inspired by several others (particularly the lab manuals of [Anne Urai](https://github.com/anne-urai/lab_wiki), [Liad Mudrik](https://people.socsci.tau.ac.il/mu/mudriklab/lab-philosophy-and-procedures/), [Mariam Aly](https://osf.io/mdh87/wiki/home/), [Trina MacMahon](https://d1uqjtzsuwlnsf.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/163/2016/11/McMahon_UW_Compact_Example.pdf), [Brad Voytek](https://voyteklab.com/philosophy), [Nancy Kanwisher]() and [Michael Beyer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y1wzFVdp-FCoGM47okaW5eYdOOfpgXD5nM9Q7DpwAMo/edit)). In turn, we would be glad for others to make use of this manual when setting up their own groups, and have made it available under a CC-BY 4.0 license. If you can think of anything that is missing, or things that are unclear, then please let us know - ideas are always welcome!

### First steps

We recommend reading through this manual, and exploring the links over on the lefthand side. In particular, [getting started](getting_started) will talk you through some initial practical steps to work through.

For details about our team, research and publications see [metacoglab.org](http://metacoglab.org). The lynchpin of everything that happens in the lab is our lab manager and all-round miracle-worker [Sarah Kalwarowsky](http://metacoglab.org/people). If you've read through this manual and still don't know the answer to your question, then Sarah is the person to ask.
